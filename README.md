# Password-Generator


## Overview

This week’s challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
